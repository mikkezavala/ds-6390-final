# Taxpayer Anomaly Detection

Our modeling pipeline is designed to detect anomalous federal tax withholdings in W-2 forms by combining interpretable models with predictive power. Here's how each component contributes:

## Setting up

You need to install pyenv. 

Once installed you can install the dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

We used a subset of the IRS W-2 dataset, focusing on the `box_2_federal_tax_withheld` field. The dataset was preprocessed to remove duplicates and irrelevant columns.
The reference data set was taken from: https://huggingface.co/datasets/singhsays/fake-w2-us-tax-form-dataset

You need to download (did not upload given the size and GitHub restrictions) the dataset and put it in the `data` folder. 
The dataset is around 1.5GB.

The cleanup process was done by dropping unnecessary columns and encoding the categorical variables.

## The Data Exploration

Did a small EDA and looked for related variables for our predictors and used MLR to label first the anomalies.
After the fact I decided to go with IsolationForest to classification and run a consensus model to get the final labels.

## Linear Regression (MLR) ‚Äî Anomaly Label Engineering

**Objective:** Fit a baseline model to predict `box_2_federal_tax_withheld` using numeric features.

**Method:**
- Applied a ‚àö square root transformation to stabilize variance.
- Trained a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model on a train/test split.
- Calculated residuals: `actual ‚àí predicted`.

**Labeling Strategy:**
- Taxpayers in the top and bottom 10% of residuals were labeled as anomalies.
- These binary labels (anomaly = True/False) became the ground truth for downstream models.

## KMeans Clustering ‚Äî Taxpayer Peer Groups

**Objective:** Group taxpayers with similar profiles for peer-based anomaly comparison.

**Method:**
- Applied `StandardScaler` and PCA (for projection).
- Used KMeans (k=6) to cluster the full dataset.
- Clusters help frame outliers *within* similar income/taxpayer groups.

**Insight:**
- Some anomalies clustered together ‚Äî validating their deviation even within peer groups.
- Used for exploratory visualization and enhanced interpretability.

## Keras Neural Network ‚Äî Real-Time Anomaly Prediction

**Objective:** Train a predictive model to detect anomalies based on taxpayer inputs.

**Architecture:**
- Dense + BatchNorm + ReLU
- Intermediate embedding layer (16 dims) for dashboard/visualization
- Dropout for regularization
- Output: Sigmoid (binary classification)

**Performance:**
- ROC AUC: ~0.77‚Äì0.81
- Best threshold ‚âà **0.545** chosen from precision-recall analysis

**Deployment-Ready:**
- Supports real-time predictions
- Embeddings enable clustering, dashboard integration, and explainability via SHAP

## Random Forest ‚Äî Benchmark Model

**Objective:** Provide a classical ML benchmark.

**Method:**
- Trained using `RandomizedSearchCV` with balanced subsampling
- Used same anomaly labels from MLR

**Outcome:**
- AUC ~0.77 ‚Äî solid but surpassed by the Keras model
- Retained for model comparison only, not used in final deployment
